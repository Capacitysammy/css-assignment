    <p>Early humans set themselves apart from other animals when they 
        learned to control fire. About 2 million years ago, they also 
        learned to use stones as weapons or tools. This began a period 
        that is known as the Stone Age. Stone Age people also learned 
        to make pottery from clay.
    
        Later on, people learned to work with metal. The people of 
        Anatolia (now in Turkey) made copper tools and weapons as early 
        as 6500 bce. In about 3000 bce people discovered that mixing copper 
        with tin formed a stronger metal—bronze. This discovery began the 
        Bronze Age.
    
        Two important developments took place in the Middle East at the 
        beginning of the Bronze Age. One was the invention of the ox-drawn plow. 
        The other was the invention of the wheel and axle.Many scientists date 
        the beginning of civilization, or advanced culture, to this time.
    
        In the 1000s bce the Hittite people of Anatolia learned to work with iron,
        which is stronger than bronze. This began the Iron Age. Eventually, people 
        throughout Europe, Asia, and northern Africa made strong iron tools and weapons.
        
        A period called the Middle Ages began in Europe in about 500 ce and lasted until 
        about 1500. Many advances during this time came from other places—for example, 
        China, the Byzantine Empire, Persia, India, and the Islamic world.
